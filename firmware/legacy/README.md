# Legacy - Phase 1 Firmware Reference

**Status**: ARCHIVED - Historical reference only

This directory contains the Phase 1 firmware implementation that was used as a reference during the initial project exploration. The full firmware documentation, multi-phase planning, and test suite have been removed to focus the project on a scaled-back implementation.

## Contents

- `src/main.cpp` - Original Phase 1 ESP32 firmware (WiFi + OSC messaging)
- `platformio.ini` - Build configuration
- `include/` - Header files

## Note

For current firmware development, work with the `platformio.ini` at the project root and implement new features as needed. This legacy code is preserved for reference but is not part of the active development path.
