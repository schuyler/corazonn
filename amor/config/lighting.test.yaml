# Amor Lighting Configuration - INTEGRATION TESTING
# Uses emulated Kasa bulbs on localhost for testing without hardware

# Zone definitions (4 zones for 4 PPG sensors)
zones:
  0:
    name: "Zone 0 - Red"
    hue: 0          # Pure Red
  1:
    name: "Zone 1 - Green"
    hue: 120        # Green
  2:
    name: "Zone 2 - Blue"
    hue: 240        # Blue
  3:
    name: "Zone 3 - Yellow"
    hue: 60         # Yellow

# Emulated Kasa bulbs on localhost
# Requires loopback aliases - see amor/simulator/README.md for setup instructions:
#   Linux (modern):  sudo ip addr add 127.0.0.2/8 dev lo
#   Linux/macOS:     sudo ifconfig lo:1 127.0.0.2 up
#   Windows:         Use different ports instead (not supported)
