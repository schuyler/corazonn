# Audio effects: Per-PPG effect chains with biometric parameter mapping
# Requires pedalboard library: pip install pedalboard
#
# Available effects:
#   - reverb: Spatial depth with BPM-responsive room size
#   - delay: Rhythmic echoes synced to heartbeat
#   - chorus: Gentle shimmer that breathes with heart rate
#   - phaser: Sweeping filter with intensity control
#   - lowpass: Inverse BPM mapping (high BPM = darker/warmer sound)
