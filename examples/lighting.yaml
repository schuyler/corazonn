# Amor Lighting Configuration
# Controls TP-Link Kasa smart bulbs for heartbeat-synchronized lighting

# Program configuration (callback-based lighting controllers)
# Programs control all 4 zones with stateful callbacks for beat and tick events
program:
  active: "soft_pulse"  # Active program name (must exist in PROGRAMS registry)
  config:
    # Per-program configuration parameters
    # Example for future programs:
    # rotation_speed: 30.0  # Degrees per second for rotating_gradient
    # pulse_on_beat: true   # Enable beat-triggered pulses

# Zone definitions (4 zones for 4 PPG sensors)
# Each zone has a fixed hue that pulses on heartbeat
# Heart-themed palette: counterclockwise from red through magenta/purple to blue
zones:
  0:
    name: "Person 1"
    hue: 0          # Pure Red
  1:
    name: "Person 2"
    hue: 320        # Deep Pink/Magenta
  2:
    name: "Person 3"
    hue: 280        # Purple/Violet
  3:
    name: "Person 4"
    hue: 240        # Deep Blue

# Kasa bulbs (TP-Link local control)
# Bulbs are discovered by name on the network. Names must match the
# bulb alias configured in the Kasa app.
# Run: python3 testing/discover-kasa.py to find available bulb names

# Effect parameters
effects:
  baseline_brightness: 20    # Percent (resting brightness) - lower for more dramatic effect
  pulse_max: 100             # Percent (peak brightness during pulse) - max for visibility
  baseline_saturation: 75    # Percent (constant saturation)
  attack_time_ms: 200        # Rise time to peak brightness (milliseconds)
  sustain_time_ms: 100       # Hold time at peak (milliseconds)
